## Problems I faced 
 When I click on a specific pokemon  card it opens a small floating page but the image was not fitting in the page and it was non responsive.I handled it with CSS .

 adding annimation to the pages were quite difficult .

 I added O auth login function but I wanted to make it easy running after deployment so I removed that feature .
 Because this website will be  mostly used by children so they do not need to login to access there favourite pokemon üòÇ .
